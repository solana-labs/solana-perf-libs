# solana-perf-libs
CUDA, and more!

## Building
After cloning this repo use the makefile in the root to build the tree
with nvcc in your path:

```bash
$ export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
$ make -j$(nproc)
```

This should generate the libraries:
* libcuda-crypt.so - ed25519 verify (used by leaders) and chacha (used by validators) cuda implementations

Copy libraries to the main Solana repo:
```bash
$ make DESTDIR=${SOLANA_ROOT:?}/target/perf-libs install
```

Build Solana:
```bash
$ cd $SOLANA_ROOT
$ cargo build --release
```

The library is loaded at startup by `solana_perf::perf_libs`.
See `perf/src/perf_libs.rs` in the main Solana repo for details.
